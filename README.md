# weather-app

This is a weather app, which fetches information from the OpenWeatherMap One Call API. This is my first project that uses asynchronous JavaScript. This project also uses form validation through catching errors in the asynchronous JavaScript (i.e. fetching errors are displayed as form validation errors). 

FURTHER CHANGES
1. Revisit modules and improve JS organization 
2. Add a "loading" component while the API data is being fetched 
3. Allow each card to display more information in the main display when clicked
